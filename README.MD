# PowerShell Menu Script

## Description
Work In Progress. Menus are generated in script, can be set to a fixed size or run dynamic. Menu options dynamically add. Less work than writing out stupid menus.
The fixed height broke when I did something. Need to look into that. Got kinda sick of working on this today.
